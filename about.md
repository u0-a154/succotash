This is my first repo, and actually i think still needs an improvement.
Why? look, first, the repo will have an update, until i stop, or die (maybe)
But the repo doesn't have auto update system, like oh-my-zsh, it will inform
you about an existing update, and you can run the command, like zsh update.
And i want to learn how to do that, is that we must update it per week? Or 
the script have a server that will inform an existing update? If you know 
how to do that, please teach me.
Even this repo have a simple code. I didn't know much how to code, and i 
still learn how to code.

Well actually this repo have much tools, that you can use, just simply by 
running 'git.py' this repo will give it.

And bonus
Do you know fsociety?
If you don't know, you can run 'pip install fsociety' it have many tools
that is good enough for you. run fsociety by just type 'fsociety'

Well that's it, dunno how to do auto update
